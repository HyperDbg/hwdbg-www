Additionally, the design aimed to enhance scalability and reliability to meet the demands of modern hardware.

One of the primary difficulties was ensuring the system's ability to scale efficiently without compromising performance. To address this, we implemented a modular architecture that allows for seamless scaling by adding or removing components as needed. Another challenge was maintaining data consistency and integrity across PS/PL and possible external debugger. We overcame this by incorporating advanced synchronization mechanisms and error-checking protocols."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Several key design decisions were made to optimize the system's performance and reliability.
